**DAILY TAROT APP**

This app was originally created as a fun little toy to learn NodeJS. 

I began this project before I started my first real developer job, and I added a lot of features. 

You can see it at the links below. 

Original repository: [https://github.com/davidwkaiser/daily-tarot]

Original deployed app: [http://daily-tarot.herokuapp.com]

I haven't worked on it in over a year, though. 

Recently, I found myself frustrated that I have been doing more DevOps work than actual coding at work lately, and I wanted to improve my Kotlin, so I decided to pick this project up again, and this time to start from scratch, in Kotlin, and use Test Driven Design principles.
